    <p>Description</p>
    <p>Székelykáposzta also known as "cabbage stew a la Székely" or "Székely goulash" (known as "segedínský guláš" in Czech and Slovak, "Szegediner Gulasch" in German, "segedin golaž" in Slovenian and "gulasz segedyński" in Polish) is a distinctive dish in Hungarian and Central European cuisine.</p>
    <p>Contrary to its name, it does not originate from the Székely people, and traditional Transylvanian cuisine does not recognize it.</p>
  
    <p>Ingredients (shortened list - do not follow)</p>
    <ul>
    <li>oil</li>
    <li>2 onions</li>
    <li>2 pcs of garlic</li>
    <li>pork meat</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Let's get to it!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pan, fry the chopped onion in hot oil until golden brown. Add the chopped garlic and sauté until golden brown. Salt and pepper the washed and dried meat cubes, add to the pot and briefly sear on all sides. Then sprinkle the meat with ground sweet paprika and fry only briefly so that the paprika does not burn and turn bitter. Pour the stock over the meat and add the new and whole black peppercorns and bay leaves wrapped in linen to the pot. Bring to the boil and simmer, covered, until almost tender. Then add the chopped drained sauerkraut to the meat and simmer for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the cream and flour until smooth. Thicken the meat with the prepared mixture and cook for about 15 minutes. To taste, you can season the Szeged goulash with sugar or sauerkraut juice.</li>
